# -Estimating-Durability-of-Print-Heads-Confidence-Intervals-Analysis
This analysis estimates the mean durability of print-heads by constructing 99% confidence intervals using sample standard deviation and a known population standard deviation. Based on data from 15 print-heads tested until failure, we provide insights into their performance while considering the destructive nature of the testing process.
